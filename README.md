# Garry's Mod Discord Rich Presence
 Provides Discord Rich Presence support to Garry's Mod
 
 In June 2018, Discord broke updating this through HTTP; so any Lua-based implementations of this are no longer possible. However, it is still possible (however impractical for servers) to use Rich Presence by using a binary module.

## Installation
### Binary Module (Clients)
Clients need to put the *gmcl_gdiscord_\*.dll* corresponding to the game's version in **lua/bin/**

### LUA Addon (Servers)
Servers need to install a Lua script that syncs the game details to Discord.
This can optionally be installed by players for support of single player or P2P games.

This .lua file needs to go in lua/autorun/client/
Installing this file on the server will have no effect on clients who do not have the required module installed.

## Configuration
### Setting up an Application
The first step is to set up a Discord application so you can slightly customise the display

Create an application over at https://discordapp.com/developers/

Go into Rich Presence > Art Assets and upload images of each map you want, along with an optional default image. Ensure that each map is named correctly.

Copy the Client ID from General Information.

### Configuration
Open up the .lua file and change the following variables as needed:
 - *discord_id* should be the Client ID you obtained earlier
 - *refresh_time* should be how frequently you want the display to update
 
 ### Default Map Image
 In order to display a default map image, you'll need to painfully create a list of which maps you have icons for.
 Put them into the *map_list* table.
 
 Once that's done, ensure that *map_restrict* is set to true. Change *map_default* to the name of whatever the default icon should be.

## Building the .dll
### Windows
1. Open Visual Studio 2019 and clone this repository
2. The default configuration should be "x86-Release" for the 32bit version\
If you want the 64bit version select the "x64-Release" configuration
3. Select `Build` -> `Build All`
4. The .dll should now be in `gmod-discord-rpc/cpp/build/\*-Release/`
### Linux
1. Make sure you have git, cmake, and gcc installed
2. Open a terminal and run
```git clone https://github.com/fluffy-servers/gmod-discord-rpc --recursive
cd gmod-discord-rpc/cpp
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && cmake --build .
```
3. The .dll should now be in `gmod-discord-rpc/cpp/build/`
